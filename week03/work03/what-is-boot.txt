Hello, this is explanation about linux!



Booting is a process restarting a computer or its operating system software.

It is of two types, that is:


(1) Cold booting: when the computer is started after having been switched off. 

(2) Warm booting: when the operating system alone is restarted (without being switched off) after a system crash or 'freezing'.
